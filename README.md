Onyx has her very own home on the Internet now, and all updates to commands tables, features, and more will be posted on this website,
as well as on her GitHub README file.

It includes some notable pages, which may be of important to those who wish to add Onyx to their Discord server.

## Scrolling Animations
Scrolling animations are using the amazing ScrollMagic.js library, in case you're wondering! Creating scroll animations
with this library was an absolute breeze, and I'd recommend it for anyone who wants to add some dynamic animation to their website.

## Onyx LABS
This is the experimental division, containing some new features that Onyx's creator, Silvia923, is working on at the moment
and will be in the future.

## Test Onyx Out In This Support Server

Onyx runs 24/7, so she'll always be online. :D
